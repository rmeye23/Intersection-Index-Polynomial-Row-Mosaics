Intersection Index Polynomial for Row Mosaics

This is a python code that computes the intersection index polynomial of a row mosaic that contains only crossing tiles. After compiling the code, the user is asked to give the number of columns (number of tiles), then tile type for each (ex. 13 15 15 15), and outer edge labels (ex. dcbadeabec). The program then creates the desired mosaic and asks the user if they want to see the smoothings and associated polynomial.
